# best practice

[refs](https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/developapps/addsupport/logging/loggingbestpractices/)

- clear key-value pairs
- human-readable event name
- use timestamp for every event
- use text format instead of binary
- JSON is better than XML
- event category level, info, warn, error, debug
- log into local file and buffer it
- splunk forwarder
- rotation policies, keep years of archival storage
- collect everything from everywhere
- no sensitive info tho
